# Web-Development
 This is a simple app that is inspired by Tripadvisor that allows the user to find interesting events and plan trips to various places in Corvallis, OR, USA. The user can also add things they know to the web page and have those data perserved as well. 
 The more technical specs are as follows:
- The app uses HTML and CSS to implement a well-designed client interface.
- The app uses client-side JS to enable relevant user interactions with the client interface.
- The app is served using a Node.js-based (or other approved) serving stack.
- The app dynamically generates pages based on data stored in a back end data store.
- The app’s client interface communicates with the app’s server to create, read, update, and/or delete content in the back end data store.
